        "| Greedy Search | Chooses the word with the highest probability as the next word in the sequence. | **Pros:** Simple and fast. <br> **Cons:** Can lead to repetitive and incoherent text. |\n",
        "| Sampling with Temperature | Introduces randomness in the word selection. A higher temperature leads to more randomness. | **Pros:** Allows exploration and diverse output. <br> **Cons:** Higher temperatures can lead to nonsensical outputs. |\n",
        "| Nucleus Sampling (Top-p Sampling) | Selects the next word from a truncated vocabulary, the \"nucleus\" of words that have a cumulative probability exceeding a pre-specified threshold (p). | **Pros:** Balances diversity and quality. <br> **Cons:** Setting an optimal 'p' can be tricky. |\n",
        "| Beam Search | Explores multiple hypotheses (sequences of words) at each step, and keeps the 'k' most likely, where 'k' is the beam width. | **Pros:** Produces more reliable results than greedy search. <br> **Cons:** Can lack diversity and lead to generic responses. |\n",
        "| Top-k Sampling | Randomly selects the next word from the top 'k' words with the highest probabilities. | **Pros:** Introduces randomness, increasing output diversity. <br> **Cons:** Random selection can sometimes lead to less coherent outputs. |\n",
        "| Length Normalization | Prevents the model from favoring shorter sequences by dividing the log probabilities by the sequence length raised to some power. | **Pros:** Makes longer and potentially more informative sequences more likely. <br> **Cons:** Tuning the normalization factor can be difficult. |\n",
        "| Stochastic Beam Search | Introduces randomness into the selection process of the 'k' hypotheses in beam search. | **Pros:** Increases diversity in the generated text. <br> **Cons:** The trade-off between diversity and quality can be tricky to manage. |\n",
        "| Decoding with Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) | Chooses the hypothesis (out of many) that minimizes expected loss under a loss function. | **Pros:** Optimizes the output according to a specific loss function. <br> **Cons:** Computationally more complex and requires a good loss function. |\n",
